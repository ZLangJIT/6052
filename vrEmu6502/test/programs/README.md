## Test programs.
Each of these came from Klauss Dormann's GitHub repository: https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests

I've included the source, the hex file and the list/report file to aid in debugging.

They were assembled with AS65 Assembler following the instructions. The .hex files can be loaded directly to my test program.
