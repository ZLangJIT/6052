# x65 - Visual Studio Code Text Package

[Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) is a funny little simple text editor with surprising extensibility. This little editor has matured and it's worth exploring.

As I don't like the marketplaceification of seemingly simple tools I'm not putting this on the visual studio coded marketplace, but if anyone wants to do that I don't mind.
